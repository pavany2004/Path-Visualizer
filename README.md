# Path-Visualizer

*Used Dijkstra’s Algorithm and Breadth‐First Search (BFS), two funda
mental graph traversal techniques, to help the programme identify
 the best paths.
 *Created an interactive user interface using React that
 allow users to see and understand the shortest path between start
 and end point.
